  summary: 'A Session and Caching library with WSGI Middleware'
  description: |
    Beaker is a web session and general caching library that includes WSGI
    middleware for use in web applications.

    As a general caching library, Beaker can handle storing for various times
    any Python object that can be pickled with optional back-ends on a
    fine-grained basis.

    Beaker includes Cache and Session WSGI middleware to ease integration with
    WSGI capable frameworks, and is automatically used by Pylons and
    TurboGears.
